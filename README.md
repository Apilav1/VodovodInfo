# VodovodInfoApp
This is an app that collects water outage notices from Sarajevo's government water supply company, locates areas on the map and notifies users accordingly.

## Implementation

Following recent dive into **MVVM**, **LiveData**, **Room**, **Hilt**, and **GoogleMaps** I came up with the idea to make an app that will summarize my current knowledge about these topics and to be useful to people of Sarajevo as well. 
I was also inspired by [CodingWithMitch Power Outages App][cwm].

This app uses: 
 - **MVVM** architectural pattern
 - **Jsoup** (Java HTML parser) to scrape data from [viksa.ba][vm]
 - **Repository pattern** as a single source of truth
 - **LiveData** to appropriately notifies *Presentation (UI) layer* accordingly to observers livecycle.
 - **Google geolocate API** to locate streets mentioned in notices
 - **Google maps** to display the data
 - **Room persistence library** is used to manage the data retrieval
 - **Hilt** is used to provides a standard way to do **DI injection**
 - **WorkManager** and periodic **Worker** for local notifications
 

## What I learned
- How to implement **MVVM pattern** and I made a **Medium** tutorial explaining it: 
  [MVVM w/ LiveData & How To Use It | PiLove notes][mvvm]
- How to use **Room persistence library** and I made a **Medium** tutorial explaining it as well:
[How to Use Room | Android (JetPack) | PiLove notes][room]
- How to use **Hilt** and I made a **Medium** tutorial explaining it also:
 [Hilt: Godâ€™s Response To Our Prayers | PiLove notes][hilt]
- How to propery use **Kotlin coroutines** and I made a **Medium** tutorial explaining it as well:
 [Coroutines | Pilove Notes][coro]
- How to use **Google geolocate API** and **Google maps**
- How to use **WorkManager** and schedule a period **Worker**
- How to use properly **LiveData** with multiple data sources and observe it
- How to listen to **network** status changes and respond accordingly
- How to properly hide *credentials*
- How to set **navigation graph** and properly set **transactions**
